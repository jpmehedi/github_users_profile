# Github Users App

A client app that allows you to view GitHub users.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Flutter project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.0.0 or higher)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (included with Flutter)
- An IDE or text editor with Flutter and Dart plugins (e.g., [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jpmehedi/github_users_app.git

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash

## Configuration

Before running the app, please explore `lib/utilities/api_endpoint.dart` and update the following line with your GitHub personal access token:

```dart
const String githubToken = "YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN";
```

> **Note:** Make sure to keep your personal access token secure and never commit it to a public repository.
### Running the Project

   - Check the connected devices with:
   
     ```bash
     flutter devices
     ```

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Build for Production

To build the app for production (release mode), use the following command:

- For Android:

  ```bash
  flutter build apk --release
  ```

- For iOS:

  ```bash
  flutter build ios --release
  ```

For more build options and detailed instructions, refer to the [Flutter build documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment).
